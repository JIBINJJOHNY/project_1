          "The Pursuit of Happyness" is a biographical drama
          film based on the true story of Chris Gardner's life. It was released
          in 2006 and stars Will Smith in the lead role. The film depicts
          Gardner's struggles and perseverance in overcoming homelessness and
          pursuing a better life for himself and his young son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Story is set in the early 1980s in San Francisco, California. Chris
          Gardner, a struggling salesman, invests his life savings in a portable
          bone density scanner, hoping to make a successful career selling
          medical devices. However, he soon faces financial difficulties as the
          scanners are not selling well, leaving him and his family in a dire
          financial situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris's relationship with his wife becomes strained due to their
          financial struggles, eventually leading to their separation. Chris is
          determined to provide a better life for his son, Christopher, and takes
          on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker at Dean Witter Reynolds. This
          opportunity has the potential to lead to a paid position if he
          successfully completes the internship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film follows Chris's journey as he faces numerous challenges and
          hardships while trying to balance his internship, homelessness, and the
          responsibility of caring for his son. Despite the obstacles, he remains
          optimistic and works tirelessly to improve their circumstances. Chris
          and his son often find themselves living in homeless shelters, public
          restrooms, and even sleeping on the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the film, Chris's determination, intelligence, and
          perseverance shine through as he refuses to give up on his dream of
          becoming a successful stockbroker. He faces rejection, long hours of
          work,and the constant struggle to provide for his son's well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Chris's hard work pays off,and he eventually secures a
          permanent position at the brokerage firm. The film concludes with Chris
          walking through the streets,finally achieving his dream and inspiring
          others through his remarkable journey.
        </p>
        <P>
          The Pursuit of Happyness is a powerful and inspiring story that highlights the importance of never giving
          up, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. It serves as a reminder that with determination,
          resilience, and a positive mindset, one can overcome adversity and create a better life.
